            <p>PewDiePie is a youtube gamer and I watched his play of Resident Evil 7. He breaks his play into 8 sessions of about 40 mins each. </p>
<p>I found his videos to be highly entertaining. </p>
<p>Best moments - When he yells "Box" and breaks wooden boxes for loot.</p>
<p>The main character is Ethan who gets a message from Mia saying to come save her. We find out that she has been missing for three years. The video game starts off with the Baker house where Ethan is exposed to some mutation and he battles with the Baker family. The mutation has slowly envloped the house and the changed the family. It is a type of black sludge that creates "Moist Monsters". Basically you explore the house and learn the story line. A woman named Zoe guides you to seek out parts for the antidote. </p>
<p>There are four areas that are explored. </p>
<p>The first is the Baker house and you need to solve puzzles to get access to keys, weapons, and special rooms.In the first house you battle Mia (who is infected and can become a deranged monster) and the Boss is the father.The father's ability seems to be to create moist monsters.</p>
<p>There are save spots within the house, trailer, boathouse, and boat. </p>
<p>The second area is the boat house where you battle the mother for her latern. Her ability seems is to spawn demon bugs (giant mosquitos and spiders). The goal is to get her lantern and find the two pieces needed to make the serum. In order to kill the mother you need to kill her bug spawning stomach. This boss fight takes a while as it seems that most shots do little damage to her. </p>
<p>Within the outside buildings you battle Lucas who has taken Zoe and Mia hostage. You do not physically battle Lucas but instead have to try to outwit him. He has created a booby trapped maze within the outbuildings that you need to go through in order to save the girls. You need to get two electronic cards first.</p>
<p>He seems to have engineering abilities and once you find the girls you battle the father who turns out to a super monster. To kill the monster you need to shoot out all of his eyes, there are a bunch and the toughest one is under his belly. </p>
<p>Then you make the serum but there are only two doses. You need to use one shot of the serum to kill the father.That leads you with only one does left.</p>
<p>You are given the choice of giving the serum to with Zoe or Mia. </p>
<p>If you choose Zoe, then Zoe will be killed by the top boss monster Evelyn. Evelyn is a typhoid mary and stage zero. This child is the result of experimentation done on a tanker by Mia and other scientists. </p>
<p>In addition, Mia will be killed by you after she rescues you from Evelyn because Evelyn makes her spawn into a demon (again). At the end of the boss fight, you are taken up in a helicopter where you find Mia's iphone. It turns out that Mia is Ethan's wife. </p>
<p>If you choose Mia, then Zoe is left at the Baker house. </p>
<p>At the tanker you explore it as Mia who has forgotten that she was one of the original scientists that created Evelyn. You start with no weapons but find some. As Mia you then rescue Ethan and give him Evelyns skin samples that are necessary for creating a toxin. Mia then pushes Ethan to safety and Mia is locked within the tanker.</p>
<p>The last place you explore is the mines, lots of moist monsters. You create the toxin to kill Evelyn. </p>
<p>Then you head back to the Bakers house and are attacked by Mia (again). One of Evelyns major tools is her ability to generate illusions. At one point you catch Evelyn and shoot her with the toxin but it turns out to be granny. Evelyn has abandoned her physical form and has taken over the house. This leads to the final fight. </p>
<p>The final fight is you battling Evelyn who has spawned from the house. At the last moment you discover a gun conviently laying on the ground and kill the final boss. </p>
<p>This leads to Umbrella corporations troops showing up and taking you up in the helicopter where you discover that Mia is alive and well. It turns out that Mia is your wife.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: It was a good game, watching PewDiePie play it on youtube was pretty incrediable and fun. The game is scary and freaks some people out pretty bad. The suspense in the game is good and the graphics are done well. But the moist monters get pretty repetitive and Mia is a mad scientist that has created a typhoid mary spawn that has not killed her because Evelyn (spawn) wants a family. And it turns out that Ethan had no clue what job his wife had. I guess he just thought she was a cook or something on the tanker lol</p>
<p>Would I watch it again? No. Do I think it was a great play made better by the gamer PewDiePie? Yes. He made a pretty scary game entertaining. Issam and I look forward to watching his next video game play :D  </p>
